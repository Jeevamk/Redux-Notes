- The patterns and tools provided by redux make it easier to understand when, where,why and how the state in your application is 
  updated and how the logic will behave when those change occur.

- You have large amount of applicatin state that are needed many places in app.<br>
- The state is updated frequently over time.<br>
- The logic to update the state is complex.<br>
- The app has medium or large-sized codebase,and many people worked on that app.

# React Libraries & Tools:
1) React-Redux : It is a package that react component interact with redux store by reading piece of state and dispatching a  
   action to update the store.<br>
2) Redux-Toolkit : It a recommended approach to write redux logic.It contain functions and packages that are essential for build  
  a redux app.<br>
3) Redux Devtools extensions : It shows the history of changes to the state of your redux store over time.It allows you to dubug 
   the application effectivly.
